# river-at-midnight-syntax theme

A relaxing evening. A rainy day. When gentle winds drift your thoughts away.
On those nights or days, you'd be amazed, how gently the midnight river sways.
A syntax theme, that it would seem, would reminisce a midnight stream.
So through the trees, a gentle breeze, to help you write your code with ease.
